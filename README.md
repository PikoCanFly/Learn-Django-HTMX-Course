In this part of the tutorial, we enhance our Django project by creating a dynamic landing page that integrates live movie data from the TMDB API. Building on the foundation set in Part-1, Part-2 introduces the following features:

- **Secure API Key Management:**  
  - Obtain your free TMDB API key.  
  - Create a `.env` file and configure Django to load environment variables securely using python-dotenv.

- **Dynamic Landing Page:**  
  - Build a Django view that fetches movie data from the TMDB API based on user-selected criteria (category or search term).  
  - Use Python's `requests` library to send HTTP requests and retrieve live data.

- **Interactive Forms & Templating:**  
  - Create and style forms (dropdown and search input) using Django’s templating language and Bootstrap.  
  - Dynamically render movie data in responsive Bootstrap cards.

- **Error Handling:**  
  - Implement robust error handling using try/except blocks to manage API errors gracefully.
